# ReinforcementLearningBasics

This is a self learning project based on a [tutorial] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDezJFIOU5wDdfy4e9vdnx-7)

##### ReachtheHill.ipynb :
 - We learn a simple hill climbing problem from the openAI gym modules in the notebook 

##### CustomRLenv.ipynb : 
 - We also create a custom enviroment with agents to play a blob game with Q learning.

##### DQN.ipynb :
 - Addressing the limitations of Q learning and table size being humongous as actionspace increases, we explore the same game with few modifications using Neural Networks with Deep Reinforcement Learning (this is a colab notebook)
